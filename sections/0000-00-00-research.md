My research interests revolve around *effect handlers*, a novel
control abstraction for implementing user-definable computational
effects such as concurrency, backtracking, input/output, state,
exceptions, and so forth. My work concerns both the theory and
practice of effect handlers.

  * With [Sam Lindley](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley), I
    study canonical implementations of effect handlers such as
    *continuation passing styles* and *abstract machines*. We also
    study the relationship between *deep* and *shallow* variations of
    effect handlers. In the context of the web programming
    [Links](https://www.links-lang.org), we also explore language
    designs to make programming with effect handlers safe, modular,
    and compositional.

  * [John Longley](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jrl/) and I
    investigate the expressive power of effect handlers and how they
    fit into the landscape of programming abstractions. In particular,
    we try to establish an asymptotic gap between languages with
    advanced control operators and languages without them through old
    fashion complexity theory, demonstrating that control operators
    are efficient.

  * With [Andreas Rossberg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/), I
    am exploring the design and implementation of effect handlers in
    [WebAssembly](https://github.com/effect-handlers/wasm-effect-handlers). The
    intention is to use effect handlers as *the* compilation primitive
    for implementing contemporary control idioms such as co-routines,
    generators/iterators, and async/await.

I also contribute to the implementation of effect handlers in
[Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-multicore)
&mdash; an experimental extension to [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) which
uses effect handlers as the primary means for implementing highly
scalable, user-definable concurrency abstractions.

I am a PhD student within the [Laboratory for Foundations of Computer
Science (LFCS)](http://wcms.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs/) admitted through the
[Centre for Doctoral Training in Pervasive
Parallelism](http://pervasiveparallelism.inf.ed.ac.uk/). My
supervisors are [Sam Lindley](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley)
and [John Longley](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jrl/).
