My research interests revolve around the design, implementation, and
use of *handlers for algebraic effects* to model and control
user-definable computational effects. I am exploring the design,
implementation, and application spaces of handlers in the contexts of
the [Links programming language](http://www.links-lang.org) and
[Multicore OCaml](https://ocaml.io/w/Multicore) &mdash; an
experimental extension to the [OCaml programming
language](https://ocaml.org) which uses algebraic effects and handlers
to compose concurrency.

I am a PhD student within the [Laboratory for Foundations of Computer
Science (LFCS)](http://wcms.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs/) admitted through the
[Centre for Doctoral Training in Pervasive
Parallelism](http://pervasiveparallelism.inf.ed.ac.uk/). My
supervisors are [Sam Lindley](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley)
(LFCS) and [Christophe Dubach](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdubach)
(ICSA).
