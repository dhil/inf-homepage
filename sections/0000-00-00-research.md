My research interests revolve around *effect handlers*, a novel
control abstraction for implementing user-definable computational
effects such as concurrency, backtracking, input/output, state,
exceptions, and so forth. My work concerns both the theory and
practice of effect handlers.

  * With [Sam Lindley](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley), I
    study canonical implementations of effect handlers such as
    *continuation passing styles* and *abstract machines*. We also
    study the relationship between *deep* and *shallow* variations of
    effect handlers. In the context of the web programming
    [Links](https://www.links-lang.org), we also explore language
    designs to make programming with effect handlers safe, modular,
    and compositional.

  * [John Longley](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jrl/) and I
    investigate the expressive power of effect handlers and how they
    fit into the landscape of programming abstractions. We are working
    on *semantic* characterisations of first-class control to unveil
    and better understand the mathematical content of control
    operators.

  * With [Andreas Rossberg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/), I
    am exploring the design and implementation of effect handlers in
    [WebAssembly](https://github.com/effect-handlers/wasm-effect-handlers). The
    intention is to use effect handlers as *the* compilation primitive
    for implementing contemporary control idioms such as co-routines,
    generators/iterators, and async/await.

I also contribute to the implementation of effect handlers in
[Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-multicore)
&mdash; an experimental extension to [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) which
uses effect handlers as the primary means for implementing highly
scalable, user-definable concurrency abstractions.

I am a PhD student within the [Laboratory for Foundations of Computer
Science (LFCS)](http://wcms.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs/) admitted through the
[Centre for Doctoral Training in Pervasive
Parallelism](http://pervasiveparallelism.inf.ed.ac.uk/). My
supervisors are [Sam Lindley](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley)
and [John Longley](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jrl/).
