Broadly speaking, my primary research interests are the design (semantics and type systems) and implementation of programming languages (compilers). In particular, I am interested in how to model and control computational effects using *algebraic effects and handlers*. Currently, I am investigating new compilation and implementation techniques for effect handlers. <!-- I am interested in how to take advantage of type systems to accelerate and generate efficient, portable programs. -->

My supervisors are [Sam Lindley](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley) (LFCS) and [Christophe Dubach](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdubach) (ICSA).
