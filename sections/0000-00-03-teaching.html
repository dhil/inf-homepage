	  I am a Teaching Assistant for <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ct/">Compiling Techniques</a>, a third year undergraduate course. During the course the students develop their own compiler for a subset of the imperative programming language C. The course runs during the autumn semester.

          Notably, students use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git version control system</a> to manage their coursework during the course. Each student works on a fork of a skeleton compiler provided by me. In addition, I have developed an automated feedback system that provide students with feedback on a daily basis.

        I am a Teaching Assistant for the <a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/copt/">Compiler Optimisations</a> course, which is taught by <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hleather/">Hugh Leather</a>. The course runs during the winter/spring semester. I am bridging the gap between this course and the Compiling Techniques course using a similar feedback mechanism.
